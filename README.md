# DSE6200

CSC 7710/DSE 6200 Course Project Information 

The goal of the project for this course is for you to develop a system that uses a NoSQL database 
as the backend and has a user interface that interacts with the backend. You can use any NoSQL 
database covered in this course as the backend. Your system can do anything, as long as it uses 
NoSQL database as the backend. You can work on the project by yourself or with a partner, 
expectations for individual and team projects are different. 

Your system should consist of the 
following components: 
    •  Dataset stored in a NoSQL database: you can use publicly available dataset, create your 
dataset manually or generate it randomly using a script [20 points] 
    • User interface: your system can have a GUI or a Web interface [20 points for UI developed 
by yourself; 5 points for using standard UI, such as a DB console] 
    • UI of your system needs to allow to perform each of the following CRUD operations: 
      o Creating a record [7.5 points] 
      o Updating a record [7.5 points] 
      o Deleting a record [7.5 points] 
      o Retrieving a record [7.5 points] 
      o Parameterized map-reduce query (e.g. if your system stores sales data, a map-
reduce query will calculate the total number of sales for each month of the year 
with the year provided as a parameter through a UI). Results of a query should be 
presented through a UI. Please think about a reasonably complex and realistic 
map-reduce query [20 points] 
    • Up to 10 points will be given for interestingness or societal importance of the project, data 
or quality of implementation.
